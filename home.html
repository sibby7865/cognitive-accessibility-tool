    Welcome to the Cognitive Accessibility Tool. This tool helps you find and fix barriers
    that make websites hard to use for people with cognitive differences. To use it,
    enter a URL and click Scan to generate a detailed report of potential issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will receive clear recommendations written in plain language, with examples showing
    where each issue appears. Each recommendation explains why the issue matters and how
    to address it effectively. After making changes you can rescan your page to confirm
    that all critical issues are resolved.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to help you create a more inclusive and accessible online experience for
    all users.
  </p>

         PURPOSE CARD
         ============================================================================= -->
  <div class="card" aria-labelledby="purpose-heading">
  <h2 id="purpose-heading">Purpose of the Tool</h2>
  <p>
    Many websites include design and content choices that unintentionally make
    reading and navigation harder for people with dyslexia, ADHD, or memory
    difficulties. This tool helps you identify those specific barriers on any
    webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most accessibility checkers focus on technical code compliance and often
    overlook how content feels to users with cognitive differences. This tool
    takes a different approach by combining targeted cognitive checks with a
    built-in Readability Checker that measures reading age and ease of
    understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    It provides clear, practical recommendations in plain English, with examples
    that show exactly what to change and why.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some coding knowledge is helpful, but the tool explains things where needed
    so that writers, designers, and editors can all use it confidently. You can
    scan, revise, and repeat until your site is easier to read, navigate, and
    understand for everyone.
  </p>

         ============================================================================= -->
    <div class="card" aria-labelledby="difference-heading">
  <h2 id="difference-heading">How This Tool Is Different to Existing Tools?</h2>
  <p>
    Most accessibility tools such as Google Lighthouse or axe-core are built around
    code-level checks (missing ARIA attributes, semantic HTML errors, color-contrast
    ratios). They tell you what breaks a guideline but say little about how your
    content actually feels to someone with dyslexia, ADHD, or memory challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our scanner takes a user-centered approach. You begin by selecting a profile:
    General, Dyslexia, ADHD, or Memory and the tool runs only the checks most
    relevant to that group. This keeps your report focused and fast, rather than
    overwhelming you with hundreds of unrelated issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every finding comes with a plain-English explanation and a concrete example of
    where to make the change. You won’t see pages of technical jargon, just clear
    guidance on what to fix and why it matters, backed by a snippet from your own page.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also include a Readability Checker powered by the Flesch–Kincaid formulas.
    You receive both a UK reading-age score and a 0–100 reading-ease score, with
    colour-coded feedback at the paragraph level. This lets you spot dense or
    confusing passages.
  </p>
  <p>
    No complex setup, no custom scripts, and no lengthy batch reports. Scan any URL
    in seconds, apply the practical recommendations, then re-scan immediately to
    confirm your improvements. This rapid iteration workflow helps you keep
    accessibility at the forefront of your design process.

         ============================================================================= -->

  <div class="card" aria-labelledby="overview-heading">
  <h2 id="overview-heading">How the Scan Works</h2>
  <p>
    1. Select a Profile: Choose General, Dyslexia, ADHD, or Memory to tailor
    the checks for your audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Enter a URL and Click Scan: The tool crawls your page and evaluates only
    the selected checks in seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Review Your Results: Each row shows the issue name, count,
    recommendation, issue location snippet, and guidance for interpreting that example.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Implement Fixes and Re-scan: Update your content or code, then run another
    scan to confirm all critical issues have been resolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is a sample row illustrating the output:
  </p>

  <table aria-describedby="overview-heading">

          <a class="example-link" href="#" target="_blank">
           This sentence is too long and should be broken into shorter parts to make it easier to read understand and follow especially for people with cognitive difficulties or attention challenges
          </a>
        </td>
        <td>
          Each location shows a sentence over 25 words. Long sentences are harder to process, especially for users with cognitive difficulties. Break them into shorter sentences to improve clarity.

    <strong>Memory Difficulties:</strong>
    Ensures your site has logical, consistent headings; clear, easy-to-use
    navigation; and summary or overview sections so users can quickly remember

  <h2 id="readability-heading">Readability Checker</h2>
  <p>
    Even well-designed pages can include dense or complex text. Our Readability
    Checker evaluates two key metrics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>UK Reading Age:</strong>
      The school year or age range at which most readers can understand the text.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reading Ease:</strong>
      A score from 0–100. Higher scores mean the text is easier to read and understand.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each paragraph is highlighted in green (easy), amber (moderate), or red
    (difficult) so you can spot problem areas at a glance. Use the “Show
    Problems Only” filter to focus on paragraphs below your target threshold.
  </p>

  <h3>Understanding the Flesch Formulas</h3>

  <p>
    Flesch readability tests work by analysing sentence length and word complexity.
    The mathematical formulas underlying the two scores look like this:

    />
    <figcaption>Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level formula</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We use the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level formula which is a widely used readability
    test that estimates the reading grade level of a text based on average
    sentence length and word complexity.
